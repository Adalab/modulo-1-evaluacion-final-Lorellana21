### Layout

1. The _hamburger button_ (in the top left corner) should be fixed at the top of the screen and should not disappear when scrolling. The hamburger icon must be a link to a AdalabÂ´s web page. This hamburger menu does not display any submenus.
1. First module (Anonymous proxy): it must be laid out with flexbox and must occupy the total height of the browser window.
1. Second module (Looking Through A Window): it can be laid out using CSS properties of your choice.
1. Third module (3 Reasons To Purchase): the 3 elements of the list must be laid out with CSS Grid in all screen sizes.
1. Fourth module (_footer_): it must be laid out using flexbox. All texts in the column "ARTICLES" and all the texts in the "TWITTER" column must be links to the Adalab page.

### Interaction

In total, there are several interactions to resolve:

1. The _arrow button_ in the hero module must link to the "3 Reasons To Purchase" section.
1. The footer _arrow button_ must link to the top of the page.
1. All footer links should go to https://adalab.es.
1. In the hover of the buttons ("Go" and "3 Reasons To Purchase") you must include a transition.
1. BONUS: make a small animation in the footer button.
